## ‚öôÔ∏è Getting Started

Follow these steps to get your development environment up and running.

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following installed:

  * **Node.js** (v18 or higher recommended)
  * **npm** (Node Package Manager) or **pnpm** (preferred)
  * **PostgreSQL** database (locally or a hosted instance)

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Alauddin-24434/academi-backend.git
    cd academi-backend
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies:**

    This project uses `pnpm` for package management. If you don't have it, install it globally:

    ```bash
    npm install -g pnpm
    ```

    Then, install the project dependencies:

    ```bash
    pnpm install
    ```

3.  **Set up Environment Variables:**

    Create a `.env` file in the root of the project and populate it with your environment variables. Here's an example:

    ```env
    # ===============================================
    # Academi Backend Environment Variables
    #
    # This file contains configuration settings for the backend application.
    # For local development, copy this content into a new file named `.env`
    # in the root of your project and fill in the appropriate values.
    #
    # DO NOT COMMIT THIS FILE TO VERSION CONTROL!
    # ===============================================


    # --- Server Configuration ---
    # The port on which the Express server will run.
    PORT=5000

    # --- Database Configuration ---
    #
    # PostgreSQL database connection URLs.
    #
    # DATABASE_URL: Used for production/connection pooling (e.g., Supabase pooler).
    #               For local development, you can often use the DIRECT_URL format.
    # DIRECT_URL:   Direct connection to the database. Primarily used by Prisma
    #               for migrations and other direct database operations.
    #
    # Replace 'your_username', 'your_password', 'your_host', 'your_port',
    # and 'your_database_name' with your actual database credentials.
    #
    # Example for a local PostgreSQL instance:
    # DATABASE_URL="postgresql://your_username:your_password@localhost:5432/academi_db?schema=public"
    # DIRECT_URL="postgresql://your_username:your_password@localhost:5432/academi_db?schema=public"
    DATABASE_URL="postgresql://your_supabase_pooler_username:your_supabase_pooler_password@your_supabase_pooler_host:6543/your_supabase_db?pgbouncer=true"
    DIRECT_URL="postgresql://your_supabase_username:your_supabase_password@your_supabase_direct_host:5432/your_supabase_db"


    # --- JWT (JSON Web Token) Configuration ---
    #
    # JWT_ACCESS_TOKEN_SECRET: A long, random string for signing access tokens.
    #                          Generate a strong one (e.g., using `openssl rand -hex 32`).
    # JWT_REFRESH_TOKEN_SECRET: A long, random string for signing refresh tokens.
    #                           Should be different from the access token secret.
    # JWT_ACCESS_TOKEN_EXPIRATION: How long access tokens are valid (e.g., 15m, 1h, 1d).
    # JWT_REFRESH_TOKEN_EXPIRATION: How long refresh tokens are valid (e.g., 7d, 30d).
    JWT_ACCESS_TOKEN_SECRET=some_very_strong_random_secret_for_access_tokens
    JWT_REFRESH_TOKEN_SECRET=another_very_strong_random_secret_for_refresh_tokens
    JWT_ACCESS_TOKEN_EXPIRATION=15m
    JWT_REFRESH_TOKEN_EXPIRATION=7d

    # --- Application Environment ---
    #
    # NODE_ENV: Set to 'development' for local dev, 'production' for deployment.
    # CLIENT_URL: The URL of your frontend application. Used for CORS and redirects.
    NODE_ENV=development
    CLIENT_URL=http://localhost:3000

    # --- Cloudinary Configuration ---
    #
    # Credentials for Cloudinary image/file upload service.
    # Replace with your actual Cloudinary account details.
    CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME=your_cloudinary_cloud_name
    CLOUDINARY_API_KEY=your_cloudinary_api_key
    CLOUDINARY_API_SECRET=your_cloudinary_api_secret

    # --- AamarPay Payment Gateway Configuration ---
    #
    # Credentials for AamarPay payment gateway integration.
    # AAMARPAY_STORE_ID: Your AamarPay store ID.
    # AAMARPAY_SIGNATURE_KEY: Your AamarPay signature key.
    AAMARPAY_STORE_ID=your_aamarpay_store_id
    AAMARPAY_SIGNATURE_KEY=your_aamarpay_signature_key

    # --- Payment Redirect URLs ---
    #
    # URLs where AamarPay will redirect after payment attempts.
    # For development, these should point to your local backend.
    # For production, these should point to your deployed backend URL.
    SUCCESS_URL=https://learning-platform-backend-production-839d.up.railway.app/api/payments/success
    FAIL_URL=https://learning-platform-backend-production-839d.up.railway.app/api/payments/fail
    CANCEL_URL=https://learning-platform-backend-production-839d.up.railway.app/api/payments/cancel
    ```

    **Important:** For `DATABASE_URL` and `DIRECT_URL`, you'll need to replace the example values with your actual PostgreSQL connection strings. For development, you can use a local PostgreSQL instance.

4.  **Database Setup:**

    Generate the Prisma client and run migrations:

    ```bash
    pnpm run prisma:generate
    pnpm run prisma:migrate
    ```

    This will create your database schema and tables based on your Prisma schema.

## üöÄ Running the Application

### Development Mode

To run the application in development mode with hot-reloading:

```bash
pnpm run dev
```

The server will typically run on `https://learning-platform-backend-production-839d.up.railway.app` (or the `PORT` specified in your `.env` file).

### Production Mode

To build the project and run it in production mode:

```bash
pnpm run build
pnpm run prod
```

-----

## üê≥ Dockerization

This project includes a `Dockerfile` for easy containerization, making deployment more consistent and portable.

### Build the Docker Image

```bash
docker build -t academi-backend .
```

### Run the Docker Container

```bash
docker run -p 5000:5000 --env-file .env academi-backend
```

**Note:** Ensure your `.env` file is correctly configured for the container environment, especially the `DATABASE_URL` and other service URLs.
